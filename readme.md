# Grid Trading Calculator

## Use  

This calculator can help you setup your grid trades.  It will help you to visualize the prices at which your grids will be traded, and will also calculate your profit per completed grid.  

I made it originally for helping setup my grid trades inside of the BitUniverse App.  It has a free grid trading bot that you can run on a bunch of different exchanges.

**Precision** is the amount of decimal places the pair uses into precision, example: 8 for a BTC pair on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=11996503)
